Group members: Donnie Militante, Sydney Basulto, Mia Aburto, Chidubem Adinna

## Roles
* #### Mia Aburto - Back-end
* #### Sydney Basulto - Front-end
* #### Chidubem Adinna - Back-end 
* #### Donnie Militante - Front-end 


Our program is the best way for any student, mostly UCI students, to keep track 
of the way they're spending their time and studying by incorporating studying 
methods such as the Pomodoro method. Alongside promoting better study habits we
also provide students with a way to keep their schedule neat and never let
them forget the arrangements they have made prior.

## How to run the file:
* write the Irvinehacks wifi ip address
* add a colon followed by 8000
* for example: "168.3.1.0:8000"
* it is meant to be an extension however due to some constraints we are unable to share the extension

## How we made it:

Technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Python Django, Python Sqlalchemy

Throughout the teamwork process, we designated tasks to each other and split half and half
among front-end programmers and back-end programmers. Our front-end team started by
creating the concept of the sprite work they were going toward, laying the foundation and the
vision for what would come next. Once we were locked onto our idea, our back-end developers began
assisting and trying to communicate what would be needed next for our operation. The main focus in
the back-end was setting up a database to hold all the items of the to-do list and we achieved that 
through the use of Sqlalchemy creating the center of our ideas. Alongside setting up Sqlalchemy 
our backend worked out the complications of hosting a server through Python's Django framework, which 
allows live updates, and gave our code the ability to affect the web server that was being hosted.
With those separate segments complete, our front-end team completed sprite work and was working on
the animation of our "Zotbuddy". Since the front end was done completely without a framework, every
animation and asset being incorporated to our finished product was done in raw HTML, CSS, and
Javascript. The hardest part was joining everything together from combining the database and webserver to
actually, connecting every asset to map to the website.

## Our key takeaways:

For the majority of the team, this was our first hackathon and 2 big takeaways. The first one is the stress of
working under pressure under such a strict time crunch where every second counts and every person in the room 
is on edge attempting to flesh out their best ideas. Although troubling in the beginning, only under such strict
conditions can the most creative and hardworking team be seen. Our second biggest takeaway is about brainstorming
brainstorming determines your path for the rest of the competition and if a single second is wasted on the wrong idea
that's just how much further back you are set from the rest of the competition. We, unfortunately, went through this 
unfortunate situation of deciding on one topic only to realize how impossible the task would be to complete in our 
allotted time. However, this allowed for a brighter and more creative idea to grow from the remains of the previous
one. Moving forward, with the experience we gained from this hackathon, it will allow us to be even more decisive and
focused under pressure.
