# IrvineHacks 2025 Hackathon: Zotbuddy

Group members: Donnie Militante, Sydney Basulto, Mia Aburto, Chidubem Adinna

Our program is the best way for any student, mostly UCI students, to keep track 
of the way they're spending their time and studying by incorporating studying 
methods such as the Pomodoro method. Alongside promoting better study habits we
also provide students with a way to keep their schedule neat and never let
them forget the arrangements they have made prior.

### How to clone the repo:

## How we made it:

Technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript, python, python Django, python Sqlalchemy

Throughout the teamwork process, we designated tasks to each other and split half and half
among front-end programmers and back-end programmers. Our front-end team started by
creating the concept of the sprite work they were going toward, laying the foundation and the
vision for what would come next. Once we were locked onto our idea, our back-end developers began
assisting and trying to communicate what would be needed next for our operation. The main focus in
the back-end was setting up a database to hold all the items of the to-do list and we achieved that 
through the use of Sqlalchemy creating the center of our ideas. Alongside setting up Sqlalchemy 
our backend worked out the complications of hosting a server through Python's Django framework, which 
allows live updates, and gave our code the ability to affect the web server that was being hosted.
With those separate segments complete, our front-end team completed sprite work and was working on
the animation of our "Zotbuddy". Since the front end was done completely without a framework, every
animation and asset being incorporated to our finished product was done in raw HTML, CSS, and
Javascript. The hardest part was joining everything together from combining the database and webserver to
actually, connecting every asset to map to the website.
